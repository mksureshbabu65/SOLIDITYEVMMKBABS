# Solidity Creating Token
This is a  project in solidity in the platform of Metacrafters.com

## Description
This project includes a SolidityToken.sol file in which MyToken contract is written in Solidity version 0.8.18. 
MyToken is a simple token contract in which public variables having token details like token name, token abbreviation, total token supply and mapping of addresses to token balances. This contract also includes a mint function for minting of new tokens and a burn function for burning of available tokens by specified value in parameters of the functions. Both mint and burn functions take token address and value as parameters. Burn function also verifies that the available balance in token address is greater than or equal to the value given.

## Getting Started
### Executing Program
